## Lesson Plan: Introduction to Python Variables

### Hook/Mini Lesson (5 minutes)
Start by asking students what they know about variables in programming. Explain that variables are like labeled boxes where we can store data or values for later use. Introduce the concept of assigning values to variables in Python.

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)
1. Demonstrate how to create a variable and assign a value to it in Python.
2. Show examples of different data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans) and how to assign them to variables.
3. Explain the rules for naming variables in Python (e.g., no spaces, start with a letter or underscore).
4. Demonstrate how to print the value of a variable using the `print()` function.
5. Guide students through a few examples, assigning values to variables and printing them.

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)
1. Ask students to create variables for their name, age, and a favorite food, assigning appropriate values.
2. Have them print the values of these variables.
3. Challenge them to create a variable that combines their name and age into a single string.

### Discussion Questions (5 minutes)
1. What are variables used for in programming? (Answer: To store data or values for later use.)
2. What are the rules for naming variables in Python? (Answer: No spaces, start with a letter or underscore, can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.)
3. Can you change the value of a variable after it has been assigned? (Answer: Yes, you can reassign a new value to an existing variable.)

### Wrap-up (5 minutes)
Summarize the key points about variables in Python, including their purpose, how to create and assign values, and the naming rules. Emphasize the importance of using descriptive variable names for better code readability.

### Exit Ticket (5 minutes)
1. What is the difference between an integer and a float data type?
2. Write a Python statement that creates a variable called `message` and assigns it the value `"Hello, World!"`.



## Lesson Plan: Exploring Python Variables

### Hook/Mini Lesson (5 minutes)
Show students a simple Python program that uses variables to perform a calculation or manipulate data. Explain that variables are like containers that hold values, and we can use them to store and manipulate data in our programs.

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)
1. Introduce the concept of variable assignment and demonstrate how to create a variable and assign a value to it in Python.
2. Show examples of different data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans) and how to assign them to variables.
3. Explain the rules for naming variables in Python (e.g., no spaces, start with a letter or underscore, case-sensitive).
4. Demonstrate how to reassign a new value to an existing variable.
5. Guide students through examples of using variables in simple calculations and string concatenation.

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)
1. Ask students to create variables for their name, age, and a favorite hobby, assigning appropriate values.
2. Have them create a new variable that combines their name and age into a single string.
3. Challenge them to create a variable that calculates the number of days they have been alive based on their age.

### Discussion Questions (5 minutes)
1. Why is it important to use descriptive variable names in programming? (Answer: For better code readability and maintainability.)
2. Can you have two variables with the same name in Python? (Answer: No, variable names must be unique within the same scope.)
3. What happens if you try to print a variable that hasn't been assigned a value? (Answer: It will raise a `NameError` exception.)

### Wrap-up (5 minutes)
Summarize the key points about variables in Python, including their purpose, how to create and assign values, and the naming rules. Emphasize the importance of using variables to store and manipulate data in programs.

### Exit Ticket (5 minutes)
1. What is the difference between the `=` and `==` operators in Python?
2. Write a Python statement that creates a variable called `is_student` and assigns it the boolean value `True`.
